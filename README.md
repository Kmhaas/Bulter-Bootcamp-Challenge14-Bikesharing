## Summary: 

* Based on the results above the bike sharing model is working in NYC. The city is densely populated as can be see with the top starting and ending locations being almost identical however it seems there are more ending locations outside of the inner city than the starting locations. I believe this is a good sign for the city of Des Moines where the city is more spread out. Males and male subscribers are the highest users for the bike sharing which also I believe is good for the city of Des Moines. The bike repairs chart shows majority of bike have been repaired. This is shown in the "yellowish" colors of the temperature color map resulting in maintenance being a key role for success of the bike sharing program.
* An additional visualization I would perform would be the life expectancy of any given bike. 
* An additional visualization I would perform would be the age group of users to see who the largest target audience is and what audience can be more targeted.
